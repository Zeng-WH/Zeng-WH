I am **Weihao Zeng**, an incoming PhD student supervised by [Prof. Junxian He](https://jxhe.github.io/) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology starting in the fall of 2025. My research interests primarily focus on large language model alignment, encompassing **SFT data engineering** and exploration of model **reasoning capabilities**. Previously, I focused on task-oriented dialogue systems, including dialogue pre-training. I have published several papers at NLP conferences such as ACL, ICLR, SIGIR, EMNLP, and NAACL.
